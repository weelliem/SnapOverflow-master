## Introduction
We are living in a world of connectivity with social media applications like Facebook and Instagram
allowing more and more people to connect with each other in unimaginable ways at just a touch of
their figure tips. This application will allow students/friends to connect and communicate with each other via geo-location. 
The application will allow students/friends to tag a geolocation with an image / message of a question that they need
assistance with and other students/friends within the area can comment / reply to the image /
message with a solution to the question. Overall the aim is to create a giant discussion board that
allow students to help and interact with each other in real time
